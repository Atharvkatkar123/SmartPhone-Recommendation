Certainly! The project is a Smartphone Recommendation System implemented using Tkinter, a Python GUI library. The goal of the system is to recommend smartphones based on user-specified criteria such as RAM, ROM, battery capacity, and brand preference.

The project consists of multiple windows:

1. Starting Window: This window serves as the entry point of the application. It displays a simple "Start" button. When the button is clicked, it opens the main Recommendation System Window.

2. Recommendation System Window: This is the main window where users can specify their filtering criteria and view the recommended smartphones. It includes the following components:

   - Filter Inputs: Users can enter their desired values for RAM, ROM, battery capacity, and brand preference.
   - Apply Filter Button: When clicked, this button applies the filtering criteria to the dataset of smartphones and displays the results in the Result Listbox.
   - Result Listbox: This listbox displays the filtered smartphones based on the user's criteria. If no results are found, a corresponding message is displayed.
   - Google Search Functionality: Users can double-click on a smartphone in the Result Listbox to search for its reviews on Google.
   - Top Rated Phones: A separate section displays the top-rated phones based on the filtered criteria. The list is dynamically updated based on the applied filters.

Overall, the project allows users to filter and find smartphones that meet their specifications and preferences, and provides an option to explore reviews of the selected phones through a Google search.
