   - Filter Inputs: Users can enter their desired values for RAM, ROM, battery capacity, and brand preference.
   - Apply Filter Button: When clicked, this button applies the filtering criteria to the dataset of smartphones and displays the results in the Result Listbox.
   - Result Listbox: This listbox displays the filtered smartphones based on the user's criteria. If no results are found, a corresponding message is displayed.
   - Google Search Functionality: Users can double-click on a smartphone in the Result Listbox to search for its reviews on Google.
   - Top Rated Phones: A separate section displays the top-rated phones based on the filtered criteria. The list is dynamically updated based on the applied filters.
